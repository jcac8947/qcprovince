      Home to the last few untouched mini-forests in Cagbalete Island, Nilandingan Cove also has some of the largest and oldest standing trees, a swamp where you can witness "Lambanog" being made from the extracts of the Sasa plant, a fishpond where you can catch uncultured fish and other marine life, explore the Mangrove Forests, watch the flying fish glide beside your boat, see the underwater landscape through its crystal clear waters, watch fireflies flutter around your bed at night and hear the monkeys jumping from tree to tree under the moonlight. Not to mention, the Sunrise which would probably land itself among the top places to view it in the country.
