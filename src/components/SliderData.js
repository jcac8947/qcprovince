      Upon arriving at Jomalig island, I noticed this glistening golden sand from afar.
    
    That’s Salibungot beach, considered as the main beach of the island where more travelers enjoy swimming and beach bumming. But we weren’t able to experience that by the time we arrived. It was already 11am, and we went straight to the resort, which is a motorcycle ride away or habal-habal.`,
